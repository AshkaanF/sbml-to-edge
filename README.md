## SBML-to-edge
This R function converts whole genome metabolic models in **S**ystems **B**iology **M**arkup **L**anguage format (e.g., those generated by the [ModelSEED](http://seed-viewer.theseed.org/seedviewer.cgi?page=ModelView) pipeline) to edge lists for topological analyses and visualization. Edge lists comprise reactants and products, as described in the suite of papers described [here](http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/software_netseed.html). It depends on `library(SBMLR)`.
